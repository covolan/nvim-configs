# Tools configurations 

This is my repository for keeping my tools configurations.

I have configurations for NeoVim, i3 WM, rofi and polybar.

This configurations are free of use for anyone that wish to copy them. Some of them are pretty standart
as I usually take the defaut configuration and modify it to my needs.
All of the applications are using the catppuccin theme.

For the neovim installation, I used Fuse to run the appimage. also needed `git`, `make`, `unzip`, `gcc` and
`ripgrep`.

For the i3 installation the dependencies of my configuration are: `polybar`, `picom`, `feh`, `rofi` and `gnome-screenshot`.

For the rofi configuration, i basically installed the catppucinn frappe theme.
